# TeacherScheduler

## Situation:
Currently, the principal of Hamilton Elementary School is responsible for manually assembling schedules for paraprofessionals (paras) for the school year. To do this, a variety of variables must be taken into consideration; these include para qualifications, para availability, and existing student needs in various grade levels. The current system is time consuming and cannot easily adapt when changes arise.

## Objective:
Collaborate with Hamilton Elementary School to design and implement a system that automates the creation of para schedules.

## Business Benefits:
*	Save countless hours currently dedicated to manual schedule creation
*	Incorporate a variety of variables that otherwise would not be considered because of the time constraint involved with schedule creation
*	Easily adapt when circumstances change involving teacher staff

## Project Goals:
*	Designate staff schedules and responsibilities for upcoming school years
*	Determine the variables that must be considered when creating staff schedules
*	Determine schedule conflicts that may arise amongst students and paras
*	Generate easily readable daily timetables
*	Generate printable reports
*	Create an alert system that informs staff of schedule changes.
